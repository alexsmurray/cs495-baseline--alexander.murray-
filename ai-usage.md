# AI Usage Note

I used Gemini to:
- Help me resolve an error message I was getting when trying to run my unit tests. This was the first time I tried writing Python code in IntelliJ.

What I did myself:

- I used the provided resources to help with unit testing.
- I looked up palindrome sentences to use for my testing.
- I solved the problem of checking strings for palindromes and wrote some test cases for unit testing

Verification:

- I used a response from [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/931092/how-do-i-reverse-a-string-in-python) to help with reversing the string using splicing:
- I used [this website](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/icon/oddsends/palinsen.htm) for finding palindrom sentences:
